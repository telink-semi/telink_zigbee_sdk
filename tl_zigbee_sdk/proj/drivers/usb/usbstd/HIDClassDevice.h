/** \brief HID Class Device Mode Configuration and State Structure.
 *
 *  Class state structure. An instance of this structure should be made for each HID interface
 *  within the user application, and passed to each of the HID class driver functions as the
 *  \c HIDInterfaceInfo parameter. This stores each HID interface's configuration and state information.
 *
 *  \note Due to technical limitations, the HID device class driver does not utilize a separate OUT
 *        endpoint for host->device communications. Instead, the host->device data (if any) is sent to
 *        the device via the control endpoint.
