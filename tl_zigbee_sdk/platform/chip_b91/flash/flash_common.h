/**
 * @brief       This function serves to read flash mid and uid,and check the correctness of mid and uid.
 * @param[out]  flash_mid   - Flash Manufacturer ID.
 * @param[out]  flash_uid   - Flash Unique ID.
 * @return      0: flash no uid or not a known flash model   1:the flash model is known and the uid is read.
 * @note        Attention: Before calling the FLASH function, please check the power supply voltage of the chip.
 *              Only if the detected voltage is greater than the safe voltage value, the FLASH function can be called.
 *              Taking into account the factors such as power supply fluctuations, the safe voltage value needs to be greater
 *              than the minimum chip operating voltage. For the specific value, please make a reasonable setting according
 *              to the specific application and hardware circuit.
 *
 *              Risk description: When the chip power supply voltage is relatively low, due to the unstable power supply,
 *              there may be a risk of error in the operation of the flash (especially for the write and erase operations.
 *              If an abnormality occurs, the firmware and user data may be rewritten, resulting in the final Product failure)
