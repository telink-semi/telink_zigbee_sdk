    Note:
    1 If tRES1 > 25us, update the delay of EFUSE_LOAD_AND_FLASH_WAKEUP_LOOP_NUM in the S file.
      If tRES1 > 150us, this flash model cannot be used, because the chip hardware boot program only waits for 150us.
    2 Flash trim scheme has been added for P25Q80U.If other types of flash adds this scheme, user need to modify "flash_trim" and "flash_trim_check" function.
    3 PY25Q128H power supply from VBAT(not VDDF) for the following reasons:
      (1) The power supply range of PY25Q128H is 2.7-3.6V, not wide-voltage flash.
      (2) Due to the chip power-on startup will limit the current to the flash, resulting in power on the chip has been ready, but the high-voltage flash power-up is slower resulting in not yet ready,
          this time the chip fetch instruction from flash will cause problems, so flash power supply from VBAT, which allows the chip and the flash to be synchronized to power up.
    4 16 Bytes Program Time:
      If the flash is ETOX process, BLE requires 16bytes program time below 200us, if it is SONOS process, BLE requires 16bytes program time below 2.5ms,
      if the 16bytes program time of the corresponding flash exceeds the above standard or it is a flash of other process, you need to further confirm with BLE to see if the flash is available.
    5 The chip's power supply to internal the flash is VDDF(2.8V), and the internal flash must be wide-voltage flash

 * @brief       This function serves to read flash mid and uid,and check the correctness of mid and uid.

 * @param[out]  flash_uid   - Flash Unique ID.
 * @return      0: flash no uid or not a known flash model   1:the flash model is known and the uid is read.
 * @note        Attention: Before calling the FLASH function, please check the power supply voltage of the chip.
 *              Only if the detected voltage is greater than the safe voltage value, the FLASH function can be called.
 *              Taking into account the factors such as power supply fluctuations, the safe voltage value needs to be greater
 *              than the minimum chip operating voltage. For the specific value, please make a reasonable setting according
 *              to the specific application and hardware circuit.
 *
 *              Risk description: When the chip power supply voltage is relatively low, due to the unstable power supply,
 *              there may be a risk of error in the operation of the flash (especially for the write and erase operations.
 *              If an abnormality occurs, the firmware and user data may be rewritten, resulting in the final Product failure)
