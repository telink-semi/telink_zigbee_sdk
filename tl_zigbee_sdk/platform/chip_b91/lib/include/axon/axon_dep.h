 * will need to wake the system from WFI(). The driver will invoke AxonHostEnableInterrupts()
 * upon return from AxonHostWfi().  Interrupt should not be processed until AxonHostEnableInterrupts()
 * is called.

 * same as Synchronous mode.

 * that is set in the ISR, but the duration will be very short before calling AxonHostEnableInterrupts().

 * AxonHostEnableInterrupts), so the host need not worry if the state upon entry was with interrupts already
 * disabled.
