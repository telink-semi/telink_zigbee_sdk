 *  How to use this driver
 *  ==============
 The i2c has two modules: i2c/i2c1_m
- i2c(It can be used as a master or slave)
 -# i2c Master
  -# Initialization and Configuration
     -# nodma/dma:
        - Initialize the sda/scl pin by i2c_set_pin() API;
        - Configure the speed by i2c_set_master_clk() API;
        - Enable master function by i2c_master_init() API;
     -# dma
        - dma initial configuration by i2c_set_rx_dma_config() / i2c_set_tx_dma_config() API;
  -# Interrupts Configuration and Response
     -# interrupt initial configuration:
        - nodma_write
           - polling write, it does not need to configure interrupt;
        - nodma_read
           - polling read, it does not need to configure interrupt;
        - dma_write/dma_read
           - i2c_set_irq_mask() : I2C_MASTER_NAK_MASK;

      - When the slave is not used with stretch function, if I2C_SLAVE_WR_MASK is used to interrupt to judge when the master reads and fills the data, the mcu cannot handle it. Therefore, it is necessary to fill the data in advance before the master read data (nodma:i2c_slave_write() dma:i2c_slave_set_tx_dma());
      - The i2c_master_send_stop() API is used to determine whether the master sends a stop signal after the sending or receiving is complete

       - Enable master function by i2c1_m_master_init() API;
     -# TX and RX(For write and read, you can optionally add an address)
       - i2c1_m_master_write() API,if send the address, just put the address in the txbuff and send it together as data;
       - i2c1_m_master_write_read() API;
     -# the attention:
       - The i2c1_m_master_send_stop() API is used to determine whether the master sends a stop signal after the sending or receiving is complete;
- Timeout mechanism(i2c/i2c1_m)
     -# i2c_set_error_timeout()/i2c1_m_set_error_timeout():define global variable g_i2c_error_timeout_us/g_i2c1_m_error_timeout_us,
        the default value is a large value,can use the preceding interfaces to adjust the value based on actual applications.
     -# i2c_get_error_timeout_code()/i2c1_m_get_error_timeout_code(): when an error timeout abnormally, can use the above interface to read which error belongs to i2c_api_error_code_e/i2c1_m_api_error_code_e.
     -# i2c_timeout_handler()/i2c1_m_timeout_handler():when an error timeout exits abnormally,can do timeout processing at the application layer or the application layer redefines the interface.
