 *                  - When preempt_en = 1 and interrupt nesting is enabled (plic_preempt_feature_en):
 *                      - During the flash functions execution, the threshold of the PLIC is set to the maximum of the threshold before calling the interface and the given threshold value. \n
 *                        This means that when the external interrupt priority is greater than this maximum value, the execution of the flash function is disturbed by this interrupt.
 *                      - machine timer and software interrupt will definitely interrupt the flash functions execution, they are not controlled by the plic interrupt threshold
 *                  - In other cases(preempt_en = 0 or plic_preempt_feature_en = 0), global interrupts (including machine timer and software interrupt) will be turned off during the execution of the flash functions and will be restored when the flash functions exits.
